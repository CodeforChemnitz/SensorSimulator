# SensorSimulator

## Requirements

    pip install -r requirements.txt

You also need to run the SensorAPI - https://github.com/CodeforChemnitz/SensorAPI

If this runs on a different host you need to change the variable `API_HOST` in api.py.

## Run

    python api.py

Now you can connect to the simulator on http://localhost:5001.

It behaves like https://git.dinotools.org/poc/SensorNodeESP8266/about/
